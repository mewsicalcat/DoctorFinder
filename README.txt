-make password file so can remove login credentials from results.php

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SSHing: 
-I enabled X11 forwarding when ssh'ing from my mac to the ugrad machines. I created an alias inside my .bash_profile for this to shorten the process, but it's not necessary. From your mac, just run "ssh -X username@ugrad9.cs.jhu.edu"
-whenever I try to push updated files to the repository using git on the ugrad machines, a dialog will pop up prompting your github username and password. This is the reason I enabled X11 fowarding when I'm ssh'ing in
